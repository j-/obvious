# obvious

Make your terminal obvious.

Use `obvious` after a long process to indicate completion. Useful if you're far away and cannot read your terminal but can still see the screen.

Just run `obvious` after a process and your screen will flash indefinitely after that process has completed.

```sh
# wait 5 seconds before running obvious
$ sleep 5; obvious
```

## Usage

See [USAGE](USAGE) for options.

## Installing

You can use `obvious` to notify you when `obvious` has been successfully installed.

With [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

```sh
$ npm install -g obvious && obvious
```
